1. Identifying Customers with Multiple Purchases in the Same Day (SQL Query)
sql
Copy code
SELECT customer_id, purchase_date
FROM purchases
GROUP BY customer_id, purchase_date
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
This SQL query groups purchases by customer_id and purchase_date, then filters for cases where a customer has made more than one purchase on the same day.

2. Efficient Join on Large Datasets in a Distributed Environment
In a distributed environment (like Spark or Hadoop):

Use Salting: Distribute data across nodes using a common join key to minimize data shuffling.
Broadcast Small Tables: Broadcast smaller tables to all nodes to reduce data movement.
Partition Data: Ensure data is evenly partitioned and join operations leverage partition pruning.

3. Performance Implications of CROSS JOIN on Massive Datasets
Explosion in Data: CROSS JOIN generates a Cartesian product, resulting in an exponential increase in rows.
Memory and Processing: It can overwhelm memory and computational resources, leading to performance degradation or out-of-memory errors.
Avoidance: Use cautiously; consider alternatives like INNER JOIN with appropriate filtering conditions.

4. Handling Processing of a 100GB CSV File in Python
Streaming: Use libraries like pandas with chunksize parameter for iterative processing.
Memory Management: Process data in chunks, freeing memory after each chunk.
Parallel Processing: Utilize multiprocessing or Dask for parallel processing of chunks.
Disk Storage: Consider using disk-based solutions for very large datasets, like dask.dataframe or modin.

5. Difference Between Repartitioning and Coalescing in Spark
Repartitioning: Distributes data across partitions, increasing parallelism for operations like joins and aggregations. Use when increasing partitions or changing partitioning criteria.
Coalescing: Decreases partitions by merging data, useful for reducing data shuffling or optimizing data layout after filtering. Use for reducing partitions without full shuffle.
Each of these techniques and considerations is crucial for optimizing data processing tasks in both SQL and Python environments, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets.

1. Ensuring Data Consistency and Fault Tolerance in Distributed Data Pipelines
Transactional Guarantees: Use distributed transactions or idempotent operations to ensure that each step in the pipeline either completes fully or can be retried without adverse effects.
Checkpointing: Implement checkpointing mechanisms to store intermediate pipeline states, enabling recovery in case of failures.
Data Replication: Replicate data across nodes or regions to ensure availability and durability.
Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring for pipeline stages, with alerts for anomalies or failures, enabling quick response and resolution.
2. Troubleshooting and Optimizing a Slow-Running ETL Pipeline
Performance Profiling: Identify bottleneck stages using performance monitoring tools (e.g., Spark UI, AWS CloudWatch).
Data Skew and Partitioning: Address data skew by optimizing data partitioning strategies (e.g., repartitioning by key).
Resource Allocation: Adjust cluster resources (CPU, memory) based on workload characteristics and job requirements.
Code Optimization: Review and optimize code logic (e.g., reducing unnecessary transformations, leveraging broadcast joins).
Incremental Processing: Implement incremental data processing to reduce the volume of data processed in each pipeline run.
3. Experience with Cloud Technologies (AWS/GCP)
AWS: Used services like Amazon S3 for storage, EC2 for compute, and AWS Glue for ETL due to scalability, reliability, and integration capabilities.
GCP: Leveraged Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Compute Engine, and BigQuery for data warehousing and analytics, drawn to managed services and tight integration with other Google Cloud products.
4. Experience with Apache Kafka or Similar Real-Time Streaming Platforms
Apache Kafka: Managed Kafka clusters for real-time event streaming, enabling high-throughput, fault-tolerant message delivery.
Use Cases: Implemented streaming data pipelines for real-time analytics, log aggregation, and event-driven architectures.
Features: Utilized Kafka Connect for data integration, Kafka Streams for stream processing, and Kafka's strong ecosystem for scalable, distributed systems.
5. Schema Evolution in Distributed Data Stores (HBase/Cassandra)
HBase/Cassandra: Managed schema evolution by adding new columns or modifying existing ones without downtime.
Compatibility: Ensured compatibility across schema versions using techniques like backward and forward compatibility checks.
Tooling: Used tools like Apache Avro or Protobuf for schema serialization and handling schema changes in distributed environments.
6. Spark Streaming: Handling Windowed Aggregations and Fault-Tolerance
Spark Streaming: Processes real-time data using micro-batch processing, where each batch is a RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) of data.
Windowed Aggregations: Implemented windowed operations (e.g., sliding windows, tumbling windows) using Spark's window functions (window(), reduceByKeyAndWindow()).
Fault-Tolerance: Achieved through Spark's RDD lineage and checkpointing. RDD lineage tracks transformations applied to each RDD, enabling reconstruction upon failure. Checkpointing periodically saves the state of streaming application to durable storage (like HDFS or S3), allowing recovery from failures.
