Designing Order Status Management
Designing order status management for an e-retail system like Amazon involves several key considerations:

Status Lifecycle: Define the different stages an order goes through (e.g., placed, confirmed, shipped, delivered, canceled).

Data Model: Design a schema to track order status changes. This might involve a relational database with tables like Orders, OrderStatus, and OrderStatusHistory.

Event Handling: Implement mechanisms to handle status updates triggered by events (e.g., order placement, shipping confirmation). Consider event-driven architecture using message queues or event streams.

Scalability: Ensure the system can handle a high volume of orders and status updates efficiently. Use distributed systems if necessary.

Visibility and Monitoring: Provide dashboards or APIs for stakeholders to track order statuses in real-time.

Error Handling and Resilience: Plan for scenarios like system failures or order processing errors and implement appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms.



Summarizing Event Log Data Using SQL
Assuming you have an event log table (event_logs) with columns user_id, event_type, and timestamp, here's how you can write SQL queries to summarize the data:

Step 1: Calculate Time Differences Between Events
First, calculate the time differences (time_diff) between consecutive events of the same type for each user.

WITH OrderedEvents AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        event_type,
        timestamp,
        LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id, event_type ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp
    FROM event_logs
)
SELECT
    user_id,
    event_type,
    timestamp,
    COALESCE(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(timestamp, prev_timestamp, SECOND), 0) AS time_diff
FROM OrderedEvents;
Explanation:

LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id, event_type ORDER BY timestamp): Uses the LAG window function to fetch the previous timestamp for each user and event type combination.
COALESCE(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(timestamp, prev_timestamp, SECOND), 0): Calculates the difference in seconds (TIMESTAMP_DIFF) between the current timestamp and the previous timestamp. Uses COALESCE to handle the first event for each user and event type where prev_timestamp is null.
Step 2: Summarize Daily Report
Next, summarize the total time spent on each event type for the day.

WITH EventDurations AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        event_type,
        SUM(COALESCE(TIMESTAMP_DIFF(timestamp, prev_timestamp, SECOND), 0)) AS total_time_spent
    FROM (
        SELECT
            user_id,
            event_type,
            timestamp,
            LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id, event_type ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp
        FROM event_logs
    ) OrderedEvents
    GROUP BY user_id, event_type
)
SELECT
    event_type,
    SUM(total_time_spent) AS total_time_spent_today
FROM EventDurations
GROUP BY event_type;
Explanation:

EventDurations CTE (Common Table Expression): Computes the total time spent (total_time_spent) on each event type (event_type) for each user (user_id) by summing up the time_diff calculated in the previous step.
The outer query then aggregates (SUM) the total time spent on each event_type across all users to get the daily report.
Example Usage
Assuming your event_logs table has data like:

user_id	event_type	timestamp
user1	ordered	2024-10-15 08:00:00
user2	ordered	2024-10-15 09:00:00
user1	ordered	2024-10-15 10:00:00
Running the above SQL queries on this data would give you the summarized total time spent on each event type for the day.
